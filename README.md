MyPodcast is a simple prototype application that gives a user a podcasts player, with different features such as: 
- search for podcasts
- browse within a selection of podcasts
- listen to podcasts (play, stop and resume later at the same moment)
- add to favorites, share.... 

Technical:
- Implement GraphQL api support. Currently data is hard coded (I couldn't find a podcasts Rest api), but the plan is to use https://taddy.org/developers or https://features.podchaser.com/api/)
- Unit tests
- UI tests
- Data persistency (for favorites, play time...)

Design:
