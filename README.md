MyPodcast is a simple prototype application that gives a user a podcasts player, with different features such as: 
- browse within a selection of podcasts

Technical:
- Implement the API from ListenNotes https://www.listennotes.com/api/  
- Abstarct the API layer so we can switch to another API provider (spotify....)
- Unit tests

What next?
- search feature for podcasts
- listen to podcasts (play, stop and resume later at the same moment)
- add to favorites, share.... 
- UI tests (coming later)
- Deeplinks
- Data persistency (for favorites, play time...) coming later
